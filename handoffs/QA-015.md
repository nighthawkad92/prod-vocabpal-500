# Handoff: QA-015 Header/Layout Redesign Validation

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-015
2. Title: Validate layout behavior across student/teacher entry/internal states
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Ran static quality gates after shell/branding/state wiring changes.
2. Captured four visual regression screenshots:
1. student entry
2. student active
3. teacher login
4. teacher internal
3. Verified utility row ordering and state-based logo behavior.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no deployed `qa:after-deploy` run in this task (local UI/layout validation scope only).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `agent_board.md`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-015.md`
2. `qa/reports/screenshots/local-header-redesign-student-entry.png` (ignored artifact)
3. `qa/reports/screenshots/local-header-redesign-student-active.png` (ignored artifact)
4. `qa/reports/screenshots/local-header-redesign-teacher-login.png` (ignored artifact)
5. `qa/reports/screenshots/local-header-redesign-teacher-internal.png` (ignored artifact)
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
4. Playwright capture for student/teacher entry/internal states (`http://127.0.0.1:4175`)
5. Student active capture used mocked `student-start-attempt` response to bypass local browser network flakiness.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. all static gates pass.
2. required visual states captured.
3. Manual checks:
1. hero container removed from background.
2. entry branding appears in form cards with centered 250px logo + subtitle.
3. internal states show 200px top-left utility-row logo.
4. right-side utility order is Sound then Student/Teacher toggle.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-DS-014`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none (verification task).
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. local browser fetch instability to Supabase functions requires mock-assisted student-active capture.
2. Risks:
1. final deployed visual confirmation still recommended post-push.
3. Follow-up required:
1. PM signoff and push to `main`.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
