## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-073
2. Title: Add archive invariants + canonical/legacy parity checks to data-integrity and smoke suites
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-27
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
- Expanded `qa/data_integrity_audit.mjs` with canonical vs legacy parity checks, conflict-400 assertions, set invariants (`active + archives = all`, disjoint sets), post-archive movement checks, and restore contract checks.
- Added archive-list timestamp assertion step to `qa/remote_smoke.mjs` after archive mutation.
- Added new standalone archive canary runner for post-deploy contract parity and mutation shape validation.
2. What was intentionally not done: No UI redesign; no schema changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/data_integrity_audit.mjs`
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/remote_smoke.mjs`
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/release_gate.mjs`
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/run_after_deploy.mjs`
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/README.md`
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/package.json`
2. New files:
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/archive_contract_canary.mjs`
3. Commands executed:
- `npm run qa:archive-canary`
- `npm run qa:data`
- `npm run qa:remote`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
- `qa:archive-canary`
- `qa:data`
- `qa:remote`
2. Test results: Passed.
3. Manual checks:
- Verified latest reports include parity/invariant checks and passing archive timestamp assertions.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: `QA-074`.
2. Interfaces changed: QA contract now requires archive canary stage in release/after-deploy passes.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: None beyond code deployment already completed.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: None.
2. Risks: Canary relies on teacher credentials and production reachability.
3. Follow-up required: Keep running post-deploy canary for drift detection.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
