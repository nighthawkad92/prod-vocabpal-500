# BE-017 Handoff

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: BE-017
2. Title: Remove AI backend endpoints/modules/config
3. Owner Agent: Backend
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Removed `teacher-ai-query` edge function and AI shared backend modules; removed AI function config from Supabase config.
2. What was intentionally not done: Remote function/secret deletion in hosted Supabase (external CLI follow-up).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/supabase/config.toml`
2. New files: `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/BE-017.md`
3. Commands executed:
- `rmdir supabase/functions/teacher-ai-query`
- backend reference search via `rg`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
- `rg -n "teacher-ai|teacher_ai_query|OPENAI_API_KEY|OPENAI_MODEL" supabase/functions supabase/config.toml`
2. Test results: No backend runtime references remained.
3. Manual checks: Confirmed deleted backend files no longer exist.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: `UI-077`, `UI-078`, `QA-070`.
2. Interfaces changed: Removed `POST /functions/v1/teacher-ai-query`.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: Hosted Supabase should remove function deployment and AI secrets.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: None in local backend code.
2. Risks: External environments may still hold old function/secrets until manually cleared.
3. Follow-up required: Run post-merge Supabase CLI cleanup.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
