## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-054
2. Title: Implement mobile Attempts/Detail split architecture
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added mobile viewport detection (`<=768px`) in teacher mode.
2. Added mobile panel state: `attempts | detail`.
3. Added mobile tab switcher and conditional rendering of attempts panel vs detail panel.
4. Wired attempt selection to auto-switch to `Detail` tab on mobile.
5. Kept desktop/tablet split-grid layout unchanged.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no API changes.
2. no teacher backend behavior changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/UI-054.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. static gates green.
3. Manual checks:
1. mobile panel state switches via tabs and via attempt-card selection.
2. desktop/tablet grid layout path remains active when viewport > 768px.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-055`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. frontend-only: mobile panel state in teacher mode.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. frontend deploy only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. panel switch could hide context if selected attempt becomes null.
3. Follow-up required:
1. verify contextual controls and sticky behaviors on mobile.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
