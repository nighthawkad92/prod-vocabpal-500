# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: BE-016
2. Title: Update teacher AI backend contract (multi-class, timeframe, completed-only, stage buckets)
3. Owner Agent: Backend
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Reduced teacher AI intents to three, removed `actions` from deterministic/response payload, enforced completed-only attempt analytics, added `classNames[]` support with legacy compatibility (`className` -> `classNames`, `today` -> `24h`), and implemented stage-bucket support-priority output.
2. What was intentionally not done: No DB schema changes.
