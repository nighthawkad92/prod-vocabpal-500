# Handoff: QA-013 Post-Push Deployed Regression Gate

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-013
2. Title: Run post-push `qa:after-deploy` and verify prod route/data regressions
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Ran deployed after-deploy orchestrator against `https://prod-vocabpal-500.vercel.app`.
2. Verified `remote_smoke`, `matrix_ui_network`, and aggregate `after_deploy` all passed.
3. Confirmed `/designsystem` route availability and key student/teacher regression checks stayed green in prod.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no code mutations in QA task.
2. no load-test extension beyond existing matrix scope.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `agent_board.md`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-013.md`
2. `qa/reports/latest_after_deploy.json` (runtime artifact)
3. `qa/reports/latest_remote_smoke.json` (runtime artifact)
4. `qa/reports/latest_matrix_ui_network.json` (runtime artifact)
3. Commands executed:
1. `APP_URL=... SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... TEACHER_PASSCODE=... npm run qa:after-deploy`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm run qa:after-deploy` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. `qa/reports/latest_after_deploy.json` status: `passed`
2. `qa/reports/latest_remote_smoke.json` status: `passed`
3. `qa/reports/latest_matrix_ui_network.json` status: `passed`
4. matrix summary: `9/9` cases passed, `16/16` API checks passed.
3. Manual checks:
1. deploy poll marked ready with HTTP 200 before test execution.
2. `/designsystem` returned 200 in both smoke and matrix checks.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-DS-010`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none (verification-only task).
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. no migration impacts; deployment validated in-place.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking this rollout.
2. Risks:
1. none new from this gate; residual pilot risk remains external (classroom network variability).
3. Follow-up required:
1. PM final signoff.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
