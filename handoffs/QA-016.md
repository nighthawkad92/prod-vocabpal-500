# Handoff: QA-016 Header/Onboarding Refresh Validation

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-016
2. Title: Validate layout, stepper flow, class/section serialization, and regression
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Ran static quality gates after shell and onboarding refresh updates.
2. Verified student onboarding now follows 2-step flow with expected CTA/state gating.
3. Verified class/section values serialize to backend-compatible `className` string shape.
4. Verified teacher flow remains single-step while adopting updated entry branding placement.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no remote `qa:after-deploy` run in this task.
2. no load/concurrency retest in this task.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `agent_board.md`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-016.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
4. source assertions via `rg`/`sed` on updated student/teacher/shell components.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. no TypeScript, ESLint, or build regressions.
3. Manual checks:
1. Step 1 `Next` requires first and last name.
2. Step 2 `Start test` requires class + section.
3. payload uses `Class N - Section X` composition.
4. utility-row preserves Sound then Student/Teacher order.
5. entry-state logo/tagline is outside card while card title is `Vocabulary Baseline Test`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-DS-016`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none (verification task).
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. no deployed visual smoke captured in this local QA task.
2. Risks:
1. minor visual spacing differences may still need final design review on target tablet devices.
3. Follow-up required:
1. PM signoff and optional post-push visual confirmation on Vercel.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
