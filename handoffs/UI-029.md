# Handoff: UI-029 Subtitle Scale + Background Coverage Fix

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-029
2. Title: Align `Step X of 2:` to body-large scale and enforce full-viewport SVG background coverage
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Updated student entry subtitle meta segment (`Step X of 2:`) to match body-large style.
2. Updated global background layer sizing behavior from tiled repeat to full viewport stretch (`100% 100%`, no-repeat).
3. Preserved background opacity at `0.3`.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no changes to onboarding logic or payloads.
2. no route-specific background branching.
