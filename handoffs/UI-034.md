# Handoff: UI-034 MCQ Tile Variant + Design System Sync

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-034
2. Title: Implement MCQ big-square one-row answer variant and design-system sync
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Extended `RadioOption` with reusable visual variant `default | tile`.
2. Implemented tile behavior for student MCQ options with one-row layout and large touch targets.
3. Kept existing default radio behavior for other consumers.
4. Updated design-system playground controls to expose `radioVariant` and preview tile/default variants.
5. Updated design-system catalog metadata to include tile variant.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no changes to backend scoring or response contracts.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/components/ui/radio-option.tsx`
2. `web/src/features/design-system/components-section.tsx`
3. `web/src/lib/design-system.ts`
4. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/UI-034.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. static inspection and variant wiring updates.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
1. all static gates pass.
3. Manual checks:
1. MCQ option grid now enforces one-row template columns.
2. DS playground can toggle radio variant between default and tile.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-026`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. `RadioOption` props now include `variant?: "default" | "tile"`.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. one-row tile layout can compress labels if option count grows unexpectedly.
3. Follow-up required:
1. QA regression and harness verification.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
