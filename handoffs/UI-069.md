# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-069
2. Title: Remove ended->paused coercion and block pause action when no active window
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Updated teacher dashboard session status mapping to preserve `ended` and added an explicit guard preventing pause action when no active window id exists.
2. What was intentionally not done: No visual redesign of toggle states beyond status correctness.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/UI-069.md
3. Commands executed: static gates and local source checks.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: passed
3. Manual checks: ensured teacher status no longer coerces `ended` to `paused`; pause without active window returns user-facing error.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: QA-063
2. Interfaces changed: none
3. Migration or deployment impacts: frontend deploy required.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none
2. Risks: teachers can no longer create a paused window when no window exists, by design.
3. Follow-up required: none.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
