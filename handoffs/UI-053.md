## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-053
2. Title: Add attempts multi-select + archive-selected controls in teacher dashboard
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added per-attempt checkbox selection in attempts list.
2. Added `Select visible` / `Clear visible` control.
3. Added `Archive selected` CTA using same confirmation dialog copy as single archive.
4. Refactored archive flow to support one-or-many attempt IDs.
5. Kept single-attempt archive in detail panel and routed through shared bulk-capable handler.
6. Ensured post-archive refresh updates summary/attempt list/detail so averages and counts recompute.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no student-screen changes.
2. no teacher data model/schema changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass

3. Manual checks:

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:

2. Risks:
1. accidental selection mitigated by explicit confirmation dialog.
3. Follow-up required:
1. PM signoff + push/deploy.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
