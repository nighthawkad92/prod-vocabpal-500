# QA Handoff

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-001 (DES-12)
2. Title: Unit tests for scoring and timing
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-27
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
   - Added a deterministic scoring/timing contract suite at `qa/scoring_timing_contract.mjs`.
   - Added root script alias `qa:unit` for reproducible execution.
   - Validated score-to-stage mapping at both boundaries:
     - perfect run => `totalScore10=10`, `placementStage=4`
     - fully incorrect run => `totalScore10=0`, `placementStage=0`
   - Validated timing integrity on teacher-attempt-detail:
     - each `responseTimeMs >= 0`
     - `totalResponseTimeMs >= sum(responseTimeMs)`
   - Ensured QA attempts created by the suite are archived in cleanup path.
2. What was intentionally not done:
   - No frontend or backend behavior changes.
   - No conversion to a framework-level unit runner (kept deterministic API-contract QA script for current stack).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
   - `package.json`
2. New files:
   - `qa/scoring_timing_contract.mjs`
   - `qa/reports/latest_scoring_timing_contract.json`
   - `qa/reports/scoring_timing_contract_2026-02-27T00-51-34-021Z.json`
3. Commands executed:
   - `SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... TEACHER_PASSCODE=... TEACHER_NAME='QA Unit Agent' QA_SOURCE_TOKEN='7681267f' npm run qa:unit`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
   - `npm run qa:unit`
2. Test results:
   - PASS (`status: passed`)
   - 5/5 checks passed
3. Manual checks:
   - Verified report contents include stage assertions and timing invariants.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
   - QA-001 evidence now available for PM closure.
2. Interfaces changed:
   - Added one new npm script (`qa:unit`).
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
   - None.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
   - Existing `qa:data` script still fails two legacy archive-contract assertions and needs separate remediation.
2. Risks:
   - `qa:unit` is API-contract deterministic testing, not isolated in-process unit tests.
3. Follow-up required:
   - Optional: align `qa:data` assertions with current archive response contract.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
