# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-067
2. Title: Validate AI UX/data parity + static release gates
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Ran static release gates for frontend integration and checked desktop/mobile AI visibility behavior and design-system AI documentation updates.
2. What was intentionally not done: full `qa:release-gate` remote run because required env variables were not configured in this shell session.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: none (QA validation task)
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-067.md
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
- `npm run qa:release-gate` (failed fast: missing `APP_URL`)

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: passed.
3. Manual checks: teacher AI panel is desktop-first with mobile fallback messaging; design-system contains AI section and catalog entries.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: PM-ANL-006
2. Interfaces changed: none in this QA task.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: production rollout depends on CP-10 and CP-11.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: release-gate automation requires env keys (`APP_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `TEACHER_PASSCODE`) not present in local shell.
2. Risks: without post-deploy QA run, live endpoint behavior remains partially unverified.
3. Follow-up required: run `qa:release-gate`/`qa:after-deploy` after deploying and setting env.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
