# Handoff: UI-055 Compact Mobile Header + Contextual Bulk Actions

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-055
2. Title: Implement compact mobile header and contextual bulk-action bar
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Compacted mobile teacher header typography and control spacing.
2. Added compact mode to session status toggle for mobile header use.
3. Kept refresh/logout icon-led controls with reduced footprint on mobile.
4. Converted mobile bulk controls to contextual visibility (shown only when selected count > 0).
5. Added subtle animated appearance/disappearance for the contextual mobile bulk-action row.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no desktop control layout redesign.
2. no logic changes to archive API calls.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/UI-055.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. static gates green.
3. Manual checks:
1. mobile header actions render in tighter layout.
2. mobile bulk-action bar appears only after at least one attempt is selected.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-056`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. frontend-only `compact` prop on `SessionStatusToggle` local component.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. frontend deploy only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. compact controls reduce whitespace; requires touch-target verification.
3. Follow-up required:
1. QA responsive and interaction validation.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
