## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Installed `@lottiefiles/dotlottie-react` in web workspace.
2. Bundled `image-cat.lottie` and `image-dog.lottie` into `web/src/assets/dictation/`.
3. Added `QuestionVisual` mapping with Q1 -> cat lottie and Q2 -> dog lottie.
4. Added shared visual renderer supporting both static image and lottie media.
5. Applied same two-column media layout to Q1 MCQ when visual is present.
6. Kept dictation two-column layout for Q2 and switched it to dog lottie asset.
7. Enabled `.lottie` bundling through vite `assetsInclude` and added TS module declaration.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no scoring, API payload, or teacher flow changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/package.json`
2. `package-lock.json`
3. `web/src/features/student/dictation-images.ts`
4. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
5. `web/src/types/assets.d.ts`
6. `web/vite.config.ts`
2. New files:
1. `web/src/assets/dictation/image-cat.lottie`
2. `web/src/assets/dictation/image-dog.lottie`
3. `handoffs/UI-037.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm install -w web @lottiefiles/dotlottie-react`
2. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
3. `npm --prefix web run lint`
4. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. static gates pass and `.lottie` assets included in build output.
3. Manual checks:
1. Q1 now uses cat lottie visual with two-column layout.
2. Q2 now uses dog lottie visual with same two-column layout.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-029`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. `QuestionVisual` mapping introduced for image/lottie visual types.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. frontend bundle now includes dotlottie player dependency and `.lottie` assets.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. build warns about large JS chunk size due existing app footprint (non-blocking).
2. Risks:
1. runtime playback depends on browser support handled by dotlottie player runtime.
3. Follow-up required:
1. QA signoff and push.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
