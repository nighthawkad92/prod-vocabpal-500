# Handoff: UI-022 Utility-Row Parity + Entry Branding Relocation

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-022
2. Title: Apply utility-row visual parity and entry branding relocation
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Applied white-shell wrapper parity to Student/Teacher toggle so it matches Sound container treatment.
2. Preserved right-side utility order: Sound first, Student/Teacher second.
3. Moved student and teacher entry branding outside cards:
1. centered `logo-vocabpal.png` (`250px`)
2. centered line `English Vocabulary Revision`
4. Converted entry/login card heading to in-card title `Vocabulary Baseline Test`.
5. Preserved internal-state utility logo behavior (driven by existing active/auth state wiring).
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no student onboarding step logic changes in this task handoff scope (covered in `UI-023`).
2. no backend/database/auth contract changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/components/app-shell.tsx`
2. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
3. `web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/UI-022.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. source inspection with `sed`, `rg`, and `nl`.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. deferred to QA static gates after UI-023 completion.
2. Test results:
1. n/a for this isolated UI slice.
3. Manual checks:
1. entry branding no longer sits inside card containers.
2. utility-row control order and shell parity match locked decision.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-023`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. stepper insertion in student entry must keep entry branding spacing stable.
3. Follow-up required:
1. complete student 2-step onboarding and QA validation.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
