# Handoff: UI-024 Entry Centering + Copy/Subtitle Update

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-024
2. Title: Implement entry centering, form-width cap, title/copy updates, and onboarding subtitle rules
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Student entry now centers lockup and form vertically in viewport (`min-h` + `justify-center`).
2. Teacher login entry now follows the same centered layout behavior.
3. Entry form cards capped at `max-w-[450px]`.
4. Logo lockup-to-form spacing set via `gap-6` (24px).
5. Entry title changed to `Baseline Test` and left aligned.
6. Removed entry copy `Complete each question carefully.`.
7. Added student step subtitles beneath title:
1. `Step 1 of 2: Enter your full name`
2. `Step 2 of 2: Choose your class and section`
8. Removed onboarding progress bar while keeping question-stage progress bar for active attempts.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no backend request contract changes.
2. no question/teacher-internal flow redesign.

## 3. Files and Artifacts

## 4. Validation Evidence

1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.

3. Follow-up required:
1. QA validation and PM signoff.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
