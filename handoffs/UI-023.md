# Handoff: UI-023 Student 2-Step Onboarding + Class/Section Grids

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-023
2. Title: Implement student 2-step onboarding with class/section tap grids and stepper
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Replaced single-step student start form with two-step onboarding flow.
2. Implemented stepper details:
1. `Step 1 of 2` / `Step 2 of 2`
2. progress bar + percent detail (`50%`/`100%`).
3. Step 1 now collects first/last name and uses CTA `Next`.
4. Step 2 now collects class and section via touch-friendly grids:
1. class options `1-6`
2. section options `A-F`
5. Added icon-only back button (bundled `arrow-left.svg`) on step 2.
6. Step 2 CTA label set to `Start test`.
7. Kept backend request contract unchanged by composing:
1. `className = "Class {n} - Section {letter}"`
8. Preserved post-start test/audio/submit flow behavior.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no teacher onboarding stepper expansion.
2. no API/schema changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `web/src/assets/icons/arrow-left.svg`
2. `handoffs/UI-023.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `mkdir -p web/src/assets/icons`
2. `cp assets/icons/arrow-left.svg web/src/assets/icons/arrow-left.svg`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
1. all static gates pass.
3. Manual checks:
1. `Start test` remains disabled until class and section are both selected.
2. student-start payload class string now follows `Class N - Section X`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-016`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. frontend-only onboarding state types and UI state flow.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. bundled icon asset added for runtime-safe Vercel builds.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. class/section value copy relies on fixed option sets; future dynamic classes would require schema/UX revision.
3. Follow-up required:
1. QA regression pass and PM signoff.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
