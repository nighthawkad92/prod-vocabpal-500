## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-069
2. Title: Validate cross-breakpoint UX (desktop/tablet/mobile) and regressions
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Verified teacher IA split and AI panel integration across breakpoints through compile-safe checks and structural code review; mobile now renders full AI panel instead of fallback messaging.
2. What was intentionally not done: Device-cloud screenshot automation in this step.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-069.md
2. New files:
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-069.md
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
- `npm run qa:remote` (blocked by missing env)
- `npm run qa:release-gate` (blocked by missing env)

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
- passed
3. Manual checks:
- Confirmed tabs render above class rows and AI mobile fallback alert removed.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
- PM-ANL-008
2. Interfaces changed:
- none
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
- requires post-deploy remote QA execution.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
- missing local `APP_URL`/Supabase env prevents remote gates.
2. Risks:
- none identified in static gates.
3. Follow-up required:
- run `qa:after-deploy` once deployment is live.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
