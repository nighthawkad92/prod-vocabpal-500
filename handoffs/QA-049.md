# Handoff: QA-049 CI Hard Release Gate Integration

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-049
2. Title: Integrate hard release gate policy into CI and local release checklist
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Updated GitHub workflow to run release gate command (`npm run qa:release-gate`) on push to `main`.
2. Increased workflow timeout and retained report artifact upload.
3. Expanded `qa/README.md` with full suite inventory and command contracts.
4. Executed `qa:release-gate` end-to-end against `https://vocabpal.xyz`.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no branch protection policy edits from CLI.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `.github/workflows/qa-after-deploy.yml`
2. `qa/README.md`
3. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-049.md`
2. Commands executed:
1. `APP_URL=https://vocabpal.xyz ... npm run qa:release-gate`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. release gate full chain: typecheck, lint, build, qa:remote, qa:matrix, qa:data, qa:after-deploy.
2. Test results:
1. `qa/reports/latest_release_gate.json` -> `overallStatus: passed`, no blockers.
2. code/uiUx/data/api gates all pass.
3. Manual checks:
1. release report schema contains required gate domains and blockers list.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-050`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. CI now consumes `qa:release-gate` as canonical quality command.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. GitHub secrets must remain configured for runtime QA suites.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. release gate currently treats load gate as `advisory` (non-blocking).
2. Risks:
1. run time is longer than previous after-deploy-only workflow.
3. Follow-up required:
1. set `QA_LOAD_GATE_MODE=hard` only after weekly load confidence stabilizes.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
