# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-060
2. Title: Implement adaptive utility variants in app shell with deterministic narrow-screen behavior
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26T02:02:00Z
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Added explicit utility context + viewport bucket + presentation variants in app shell and replaced heuristic-only behavior with deterministic narrow-screen icon/collapse strategy.
2. What was intentionally not done: No teacher/student business logic changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/components/app-shell.tsx`
2. New files: none
3. Commands executed: typecheck/lint/build.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: pass
3. Manual checks: Utility controls now derive from explicit presentation variants and no longer depend on logo visibility to avoid wrapping on small screens.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: UI-061
2. Interfaces changed: `AppShellProps` includes `utilityContext`; new exported `UtilityContext` type.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: frontend-only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none blocking.
2. Risks: future utility actions should map through variant contract.
3. Follow-up required: context wiring from app states.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
