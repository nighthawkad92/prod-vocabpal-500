# Handoff: BE-011 Bulk Archive API Support

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: BE-011
2. Title: Extend archive API to support one-or-many attempt IDs
3. Owner Agent: Backend
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Updated `teacher-attempt-archive` to accept `attemptId` and/or `attemptIds[]`.
2. Added normalization + dedupe for incoming IDs.
3. Added missing-ID detection and bulk baseline validation.
4. Implemented bulk delete in a single request and response with `archivedCount`, `archivedAttemptIds`, and `students` list.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no DB schema/migration changes.
2. no auth/session changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `supabase/functions/teacher-attempt-archive/index.ts`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/BE-011.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. integrated static checks executed after UI step.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. static gates run in integrated QA step (`typecheck/lint/build`).
2. Test results:
1. pass (see QA handoff).
3. Manual checks:
1. endpoint now supports one-or-many archive semantics.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-053`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. `teacher-attempt-archive` response now includes bulk metadata (`archivedCount`, `archivedAttemptIds`, `students`).
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. requires `teacher-attempt-archive` function redeploy.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. destructive action remains by design; UI confirm dialog mitigates accidental action.
3. Follow-up required:
1. UI adoption + QA verification.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
