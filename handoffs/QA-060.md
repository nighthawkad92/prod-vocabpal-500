# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-060
2. Title: Validate journey reconstruction readiness in Clarity
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Verified end-to-end student flow stability with prefixed test identity and captured report artifacts for cleanup-friendly tracing.
2. What was intentionally not done: Clarity dashboard funnel screenshots (blocked until CP-08/CP-09 are completed).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/remote_smoke.mjs
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/reports/remote_smoke_2026-02-26T06-20-34-641Z.json
3. Commands executed: `APP_URL=... SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... TEACHER_PASSCODE=... TEACHER_NAME='CLARITYQA Teacher' QA_STUDENT_PREFIX='CLARITYQA' node qa/remote_smoke.mjs`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: remote smoke suite
2. Test results: passed (`latest_remote_smoke.json`)
3. Manual checks: Test identity logged as `firstName: CLARITYQA753850`, `lastName: Patel`; attempt IDs captured for cleanup.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: PM-ANL-002
2. Interfaces changed: `qa/remote_smoke.mjs` now supports `QA_STUDENT_PREFIX` and logs test identities.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: Clarity data visibility still gated by production env setup.
2. Risks: Additional QA runs create test attempts; cleanup needed by prefix.
3. Follow-up required: complete CP-08/CP-09 and verify live Clarity events.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
