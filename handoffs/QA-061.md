4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Confirmed compile/lint/build stability and verified targeted mask/unmask attributes are present in source.
2. What was intentionally not done: Live Clarity replay inspection (post-deploy runtime validation pending).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/agent_board.md

3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: typecheck/lint/build
2. Test results: all passed
3. Manual checks: mask attributes on student/teacher name inputs and search; unmask attribute on shell root.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: PM-ANL-004
2. Interfaces changed: none
3. Migration or deployment impacts: requires production deploy.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: Clarity masks input/dropdown values by default platform rule.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
