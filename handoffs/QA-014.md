# Handoff: QA-014 Text Color Harmonization Regression

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-014
2. Title: Validate text color harmonization regression gates
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Ran static QA gates for the muted-to-ink token change.
2. Captured local visual evidence for app root and design-system route.
3. Verified change scope stayed frontend-only.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no remote after-deploy suite in this task (not required for this request scope).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `agent_board.md`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-014.md`
2. `qa/reports/screenshots/local-home-muted-ink.png`
3. `qa/reports/screenshots/local-designsystem-muted-ink.png`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
4. `npx playwright screenshot --full-page http://127.0.0.1:4173 qa/reports/screenshots/local-home-muted-ink.png`
5. `npx playwright screenshot --full-page http://127.0.0.1:4173/designsystem qa/reports/screenshots/local-designsystem-muted-ink.png`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. all gates pass with no build/type/lint regressions.
3. Manual checks:
1. secondary text now uses the same ink value through token propagation.
2. `/designsystem` reflects updated muted token value and usage.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-DS-012`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none (verification-only task).
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. stronger placeholder contrast may be visually heavier than prior muted style.
3. Follow-up required:
1. PM final signoff and push.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
