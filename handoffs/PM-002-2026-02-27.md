# PM Handoff

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: PM-002 (DES-18)
2. Title: Weekly status and risk reporting
3. Owner Agent: PM
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-27
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
   - Published weekly status/risk report with current Linear state, QA signal summary, and release posture.
   - Captured current cycle completions (`DES-12`, `DES-15`, `DES-16`, `DES-17`) and active blockers (`DES-14`, `DES-140`).
   - Added clear next actions and signoff gating recommendation for `REL-002`.
2. What was intentionally not done:
   - Did not close release signoff task while hard blocker remains.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
   - None
2. New files:
   - `knowledge-base/pm/pm-002-weekly-status-risk-report-2026-02-27.md`
3. Commands executed:
   - Linear status sync and report synthesis.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
   - Evidence references from:
     - `qa/reports/latest_scoring_timing_contract.json`
     - `qa/reports/latest_load_profile_500.json`
2. Test results:
   - Unit contract checks pass; load profile remains blocked.
3. Manual checks:
   - Verified issue-state consistency on `DES-12`, `DES-14`, `DES-15`, `DES-16`, `DES-17`, `DES-18`, `DES-139`, `DES-140`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
   - None directly; report clarifies blocker resolution path.
2. Interfaces changed:
   - None.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
   - None.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
   - `DES-14` blocked on load thresholds.
2. Risks:
   - `DES-140` incident ticket ambiguity may affect pilot audit posture.
3. Follow-up required:
   - Performance remediation or explicit gate waiver decision required before `REL-002`.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Move to `REVIEW`
