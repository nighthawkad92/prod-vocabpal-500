# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-061
2. Title: Wire app/state context into utility shell across student and teacher flows
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26T02:02:00Z
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Wired explicit utility context from app mode + student view state + teacher auth state; student mode now emits entry/attempt/completion state.
2. What was intentionally not done: No backend endpoints or schema touched.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/App.tsx`, `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
2. New files: none
3. Commands executed: typecheck/lint/build.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: pass
3. Manual checks: Utility logo/context now follows student entry vs active/completion and teacher login vs dashboard states.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: QA-055
2. Interfaces changed: `StudentModeProps` adds optional `onViewStateChange` callback.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: frontend-only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none blocking.
2. Risks: context callback must stay in sync if student flow states expand.
3. Follow-up required: responsive regression QA.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
