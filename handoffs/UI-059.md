# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-059
2. Title: Implement full-screen detail sheet with icon-only back/archive and state persistence
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26T01:37:50Z
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Removed mobile Attempts/Detail tabs and added fixed full-screen detail sheet opened from list row selection; added icon-only back/archive top actions; preserved search/filter/page/selection state on return.
2. What was intentionally not done: Desktop/tablet detail card interaction unchanged.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`
2. New files: none
3. Commands executed: static gates and release gate command chain (with env).

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: pass
3. Manual checks: Mobile attempt tap opens full-screen detail overlay; back action returns to attempts without losing list context.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: QA-053
2. Interfaces changed: frontend teacher mobile panel state replaced with sheet state.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: Frontend-only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none blocking.
2. Risks: overlay layering can regress with future utility overlays.
3. Follow-up required: QA parity checks for archive/filter/pagination.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
