3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-24
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. Completed API-level end-to-end run covering both student and teacher workflows, including TTS path.
2. Verified CP-03 closure with live audio synthesis and second-call cache hit behavior.
3. Did not yet add browser-automation scripts (Playwright/Cypress) for UI-driven E2E.

## 3. Files and Artifacts

1. `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/remote_smoke.mjs`
2. Artifacts:
1. `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/reports/latest_remote_smoke.json`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. `student-question-audio/<questionItemId>` returned:
1. first call `cached: false`
2. second call `cached: true`
2. Full teacher+student flow completed in smoke report.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Provides practical end-to-end confidence for backend contracts and integrations.
2. UI browser automation remains optional follow-up before pilot if stricter gate is required.

## 6. Open Issues
1. No automated browser click-flow tests yet.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Keep `QA-003` in `REVIEW` until browser E2E decision is finalized.
