## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-080
2. Title: Add temporary dual-param frontend safety shim for archive list calls
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-27
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
- Teacher dashboard list refresh now sends both canonical `archive=` and mapped legacy `archived=` params.
- Added explicit TODO note tied to PM-QA-023 for shim removal after parity stability window.
2. What was intentionally not done: No visual or interaction redesign; no changes to archive business flow.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
- `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`
2. New files: None.
3. Commands executed: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
- Static gates (`typecheck`, `lint`, `build`).
- End-to-end QA suites (see QA-074 evidence).
2. Test results: Passed.
3. Manual checks: Verified list call now carries both params and existing UI behavior is unchanged.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: `QA-073`, `QA-074`.
2. Interfaces changed: Frontend request query now includes temporary `archived` alias.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: Requires frontend deployment to take effect.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: Shim is intentionally temporary.
2. Risks: If kept indefinitely, technical debt persists.
3. Follow-up required: Remove shim under PM-QA-023 after confirmed parity window.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
