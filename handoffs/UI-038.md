# Handoff: UI-038 Sentence Pre-Screen Before Questions 3/4/5

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-038
2. Title: Implement sentence pre-screen (image + H3 sentence + CTA) before questions 3/4/5
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Bundled sentence images into web assets:
1. `image-question3-sentence.png`
2. `image-question4-sentence.png`
3. `image-question5-sentence.png`
2. Added `QUESTION_READING_PRELUDE_BY_ORDER` mapping with sentence text and target question prompts.
3. Added `showReadingPrelude` state gate in student flow.
4. Added pre-screen rendering with sentence image + H3 sentence + `Show question` CTA.
5. `Show question` now unlocks actual question/answer screen and initializes `shownAtIso` at reveal.
6. Kept existing answer submission/scoring behavior unchanged.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no teacher flow/backend/db changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `web/src/features/student/reading-preludes.ts`
2. `web/src/assets/sentences/image-question3-sentence.png`
3. `web/src/assets/sentences/image-question4-sentence.png`
4. `web/src/assets/sentences/image-question5-sentence.png`
5. `handoffs/UI-038.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. static gates pass.
3. Manual checks:
1. pre-screen appears before mapped comprehension questions.
2. CTA transitions to actual question and answer controls.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-030`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. added local prelude mapping type for question flow.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. sentence image assets are large and increase frontend transfer size.
2. Risks:
1. slower media load on weak networks/tablets unless optimized.
3. Follow-up required:
1. optional optimization pass (compress/convert sentence images).

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
