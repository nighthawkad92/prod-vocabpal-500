# Handoff: UI-033 Question Screen Layout/Copy/Type/Icon Updates

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-033
2. Title: Apply question-screen layout/copy/type-scale/icon updates
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Removed active-question header copy (`Student Baseline Test`, `Audio must be played before submit.`).
2. Moved question counter and progress bar to a shell above the question card.
3. Replaced counter copy with `Question N of 10`.
4. Applied question prompt type scale to card-title style (`Fraunces` + `text-2xl`).
5. Applied answer type scale (`text-base font-semibold leading-6`) to dictation input and MCQ tile labels.
6. Added play icon to audio buttons and star icon to submit CTA from bundled `web/src/assets/icons/*`.
7. Updated submit ready-state label to `Submit answer`, kept waiting labels unchanged, and right-aligned submit CTA with content-fit width.
8. Added stable test hooks: `question-counter`, `question-audio-button`, `question-submit-button`.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no backend/API/schema changes.
2. no teacher flow changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `web/src/assets/icons/play.svg`
2. `web/src/assets/icons/star.svg`
3. `handoffs/UI-033.md`
3. Commands executed:

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
1. all static gates pass.
3. Manual checks:
1. active-question markup no longer includes removed header strings.
2. counter now renders as `Question N of 10` above card.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-034`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. test hooks added on question-shell controls.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. larger CTA type scale can increase button footprint on narrow screens.
3. Follow-up required:
1. QA regression pass including automation selector alignment.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
