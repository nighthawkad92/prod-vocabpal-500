# Handoff: QA-004 (2026-02-27)

## Scope
Executed pilot load profile targeting 500 concurrent student starts/submits and dashboard/archive read paths.

## Result
Load gate failed at configured thresholds.

## Key Metrics
1. Error rate: 3.57% (threshold <= 1.00%).
2. Start p95: 18847 ms (threshold <= 2500 ms).
3. First submit p95: 10212 ms (threshold <= 3000 ms).
4. Dashboard read p95: 1355 ms (pass).
5. Archive p95: 1463 ms (pass).

## Evidence
1. `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/reports/latest_load_profile_500.json`
2. `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/reports/load_profile_500_2026-02-27T00-27-29-665Z.json`

## Risks
1. Cold-start/start-attempt path is not currently pilot-safe at 500 burst load.
2. First-submit latency is above acceptable threshold and may impact classroom pacing.

## Requested PM Action
Move to `BLOCKED` and open optimization follow-up for start/submit latency reduction before pilot readiness signoff.
