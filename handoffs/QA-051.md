# Handoff: QA-051 Mobile Responsive/Interaction Regression (Teacher Dashboard)

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-051
2. Title: Mobile responsive/interaction regression for teacher dashboard
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Validated static quality gates on updated teacher dashboard implementation.
2. Validated mobile interaction path for attempts/detail panel switching and selection-driven detail navigation.
3. Validated desktop/tablet render path remains in existing split-grid layout.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no networked end-to-end run (requires full authenticated environment orchestration).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `agent_board.md`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-051.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. all static gates passed.
3. Manual checks:
1. mobile tabs render and switch correctly.
2. selecting an attempt routes to detail panel on mobile.
3. desktop/tablet split view behavior preserved.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-052`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. frontend deploy only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. mobile browser-specific safe-area behavior still requires post-deploy spot check.
2. Risks:
1. sticky layers may behave differently under specific browser UI chrome states.
3. Follow-up required:
1. run post-deploy mobile sanity check on target devices.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
