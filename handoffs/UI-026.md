# Handoff: UI-026 Global Background Image Layer

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-026
2. Title: Apply `image-bg.svg` as global background layer at 30% opacity
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Copied `assets/image-bg.svg` to `web/src/assets/backgrounds/image-bg.svg`.
2. Added global `body::before` fixed layer in `index.css` with:
1. `background-image: url("./assets/backgrounds/image-bg.svg")`
2. `opacity: 0.3`
3. Added stacking context rule to keep UI content above texture layer via `#root` z-index.
4. Preserved existing gradient background beneath image texture.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no component-specific background overrides.
2. no route-specific conditional background logic.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/index.css`
2. New files:
1. `web/src/assets/backgrounds/image-bg.svg`
2. `handoffs/UI-026.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `cp assets/image-bg.svg web/src/assets/backgrounds/image-bg.svg`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
1. all static gates pass.
3. Manual checks:
1. global background texture appears on app and design-system routes.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-019`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. adds one new bundled static asset in build output.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. potential visual noise on dense screens; opacity can be tuned if needed.
3. Follow-up required:
1. QA verification and PM signoff.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
