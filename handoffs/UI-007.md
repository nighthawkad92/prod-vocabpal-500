5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added curated SFX asset subset under `web/src/assets/sfx/`.
2. Implemented `useUiPreferences` and `useSoundEffects` with localStorage persistence, interaction guard, cooldown, and single-channel anti-spam behavior.
3. Integrated sound toggle in shared app header for both student and teacher surfaces.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. full source sound library was not bundled.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
1. passed.
3. Manual checks:
1. sound toggle state persisted across reload and reflected in UI data attributes.
2. sound events triggered for tap/submit/progress/end paths.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-009`
2. `QA-005`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. app shell now exposes global sound control and persisted preference.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. frontend bundle includes curated WAV assets only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none.
2. Risks:
1. autoplay policy may suppress welcome cue until interaction; guard implemented.
3. Follow-up required:
1. verify on deployed target and degraded network matrix.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
