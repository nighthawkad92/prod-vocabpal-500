# Handoff: UI-008 Motion Layer

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-008
2. Title: Add low-impact Motion transitions and micro animations
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-24
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added `motion` integration with reduced-motion policy hook.
2. Applied low-impact section transitions and button tap micro-feedback.
3. Added explicit runtime policy markers (`data-motion-policy`) for verification.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no heavy animations/particles were introduced.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/App.tsx`
2. `web/src/components/app-shell.tsx`
3. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
4. `web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `web/src/hooks/use-motion-policy.ts`
2. `web/src/components/motion-button.tsx`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
1. passed.
3. Manual checks:
1. reduced-motion mode resolves to `reduced` and suppresses non-essential animation intensity.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-009`
2. `QA-005`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. all major surfaces now follow shared motion policy behavior.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. no backend/deployment changes required.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none.
2. Risks:
1. low residual performance risk on constrained tablets; addressed in QA matrix.
3. Follow-up required:
1. confirm matrix pass on deployed build.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
