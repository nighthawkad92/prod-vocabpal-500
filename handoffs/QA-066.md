# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-066
2. Title: Validate AI backend contract/auth/fallback and no-transcript persistence
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Performed static contract review across new backend/frontend AI types and endpoint handling; verified 401 handling, deterministic fallback behavior, and metadata-only audit logging path.
2. What was intentionally not done: live OpenAI path validation against deployed function because secrets checkpoint is still pending.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: none (QA validation task)
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-066.md
3. Commands executed: static gates executed in QA-067 stage.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: code-level review of `teacher-ai-query`, `_shared/teacher_analytics`, `_shared/ai`, and frontend request/response usage.
2. Test results: contract appears consistent; fallback and auth paths implemented.
3. Manual checks: no transcript storage writes were added; only intent/filter metadata is logged in teacher audit events.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: QA-067
2. Interfaces changed: none in this QA task.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: final runtime validation blocked until CP-10 is cleared.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: OpenAI runtime path not executed in this environment.
2. Risks: if secrets are misconfigured, all queries will run fallback mode only.
3. Follow-up required: run post-deploy endpoint checks after CP-10 and CP-11.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
