# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-063
2. Title: Validate manual-pause-only behavior and static regression gates
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Verified status paths no longer auto-surface `paused` and confirmed compile/lint/build integrity after backend+UI updates.
2. What was intentionally not done: No live production function mutation in this validation step.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/agent_board.md
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-063.md
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: static gates
2. Test results: passed
3. Manual checks: verified `teacher-windows` GET no-window fallback is `ended` and teacher-mode status mapping preserves `ended`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: PM-QA-019
2. Interfaces changed: none
3. Migration or deployment impacts: deploy needed for runtime behavior.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none
2. Risks: none immediate.
3. Follow-up required: post-deploy smoke check for teacher status control.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
