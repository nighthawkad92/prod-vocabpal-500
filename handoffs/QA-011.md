## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Updated root `package-lock.json` via `npm install` to align with workspace dependencies.
2. Confirmed clean install path with `npm ci`.
3. Re-ran full `qa:after-deploy` orchestrator with production URL and Supabase credentials.
2. What was intentionally not done:

## 3. Files and Artifacts

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:

1. none.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:

1. remote status check still pending until lockfile-sync commit is pushed and workflow completes.
2. Risks:
1. low after successful local parity checks.
3. Follow-up required:

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
