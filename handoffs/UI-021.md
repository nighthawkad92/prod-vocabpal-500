# Handoff: UI-021 Entry Branding + State-Wired Utility Logo

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-021
2. Title: Embed logo/subtitle in entry cards and wire state-based utility logo
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Copied and bundled `logo-vocabpal.png` into web assets.
2. Student entry card now renders centered 250px logo + centered `Vocabulary Baseline Test` subtitle.
3. Teacher login card now renders the same centered 250px logo + subtitle.
4. Added state callbacks from Student/Teacher modes to app shell to control utility-row 200px logo visibility on internal states.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no backend/API/DB changes.
2. internal workflow content/headings remain unchanged unless conflicting with logo behavior.

## 4. Validation Evidence

1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass

## 5. Downstream Impact

1. `QA-015`
2. Interfaces changed:

3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. frontend asset + UI-only update.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. student active screenshot needed mock-assisted path due local Supabase browser flakiness.
3. Follow-up required:
1. complete QA-015 visual evidence + signoff.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
