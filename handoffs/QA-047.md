# Handoff: QA-047 UX Stability + Visual Consistency Validation

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-047
2. Title: Add UX stability and visual consistency checks (no layout jump, sticky behavior, state continuity)
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Extended matrix checks to current question-counter copy (`Question N of 10`).
2. Validated reduced-motion policy and sound-toggle persistence across matrix profiles.
3. Confirmed active student flow continuity through audio gate + submit on current UI.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no visual baseline snapshot infra added in this step.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `qa/matrix_ui_network.mjs`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-047.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `APP_URL=https://vocabpal.xyz ... npm run qa:matrix`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. full 9-case matrix (`desktop + tablet portrait + tablet landscape` x `wifi/slow4g/slow3g`).
2. Test results:
1. `qa/reports/latest_matrix_ui_network.json` -> `passed`.
2. reduced motion, sound persistence, student-start, and question audio-gate checks all green.
3. Manual checks:
1. reviewed failure screenshots during development and removed flaky selectors/click paths.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-049`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking this task.
2. Risks:
1. future UI copy/structure changes can break matrix if selectors are not preserved.
3. Follow-up required:
1. maintain stable test hooks for critical controls.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
