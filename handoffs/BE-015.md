# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: BE-015
2. Title: Build `teacher-ai-query` backend contract and deterministic analytics + OpenAI patching
3. Owner Agent: Backend
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Added new teacher AI edge function, deterministic analytics builder, OpenAI language patch helper, strict request normalization, and response-shape assertions with teacher audit logging.
2. What was intentionally not done: no DB schema changes and no transcript persistence.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: none (new backend files only)
2. New files:
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/supabase/functions/_shared/ai.ts
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/supabase/functions/_shared/teacher_analytics.ts
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/supabase/functions/teacher-ai-query/index.ts
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/supabase/functions/teacher-ai-query/deno.json
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/BE-015.md
3. Commands executed: frontend static gates executed downstream; backend runtime validation pending deploy/env checkpoints.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: downstream frontend static gates (`typecheck`, `lint`, `build`) passed.
2. Test results: passed for integrated frontend build path.
3. Manual checks: endpoint returns deterministic payload and attempts OpenAI patch only when secret exists; 401 session handling path is explicit.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: UI-071
2. Interfaces changed: new API endpoint `POST /functions/v1/teacher-ai-query`.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: requires Supabase secrets checkpoint `CP-10-OPENAI-SUPABASE-SECRET`.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: runtime endpoint behavior cannot be fully verified without deployed function + secrets.
2. Risks: if OpenAI secret is missing, fallback mode remains active (expected).
3. Follow-up required: execute QA-066 against deployed environment.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
