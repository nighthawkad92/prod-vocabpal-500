# Handoff: QA-005 UI Regression and Responsive Validation

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-005
2. Title: UI regression + responsive + audio behavior verification
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-24
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Updated matrix suite assertions to include sound-toggle persistence and reduced-motion policy checks.
2. Executed live deployed QA suites with refreshed selectors and timeout strategy.
3. Verified student audio-before-submit gate under all matrix device/network scenarios.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no visual snapshot baseline pipeline was added in this task.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `qa/matrix_ui_network.mjs`
2. `qa/README.md`
2. New files:
1. generated reports in `qa/reports/`.
3. Commands executed:
1. `APP_URL=https://prod-vocabpal-500.vercel.app ... npm run qa:remote`
2. `APP_URL=https://prod-vocabpal-500.vercel.app ... npm run qa:matrix`
3. `APP_URL=https://prod-vocabpal-500.vercel.app ... npm run qa:after-deploy`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm run qa:remote`
2. `npm run qa:matrix`
3. `npm run qa:after-deploy`
2. Test results:
1. all passed on deployed URL.
3. Manual checks:
1. `qa/reports/latest_matrix_ui_network.json` status `passed` with 9/9 cases.
2. matrix checks include `sound-toggle-persistence` and `reduced-motion-policy` pass.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-006`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none (QA harness only).
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. QA matrix now requires app shell policy attributes for verification.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. local-host execution is blocked by Supabase CORS (expected due allowed origin policy).
2. Risks:
1. none on deployed target.
3. Follow-up required:
1. keep using deployed URL for matrix validation unless CORS allowlist is expanded.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
