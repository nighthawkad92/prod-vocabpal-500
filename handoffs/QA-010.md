# Handoff: QA-010 Matrix Harness Alignment and Release-Gate Rerun

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-010
2. Title: Align matrix harness with audio-end submit gate and rerun release gate
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Replaced hard-coded submit button label locator with form submit selector.
2. Updated mocked `Audio` in matrix harness to emit `onended` so submit gate unlock behavior is testable.
3. Re-ran matrix and full after-deploy orchestrator until fully green.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no backend/API/schema changes.
2. no student/teacher UI behavior changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `qa/matrix_ui_network.mjs`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-010.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm run qa:matrix` (failed, pre-fix)
2. `npm run qa:matrix` (passed, post-fix)
3. `npm run qa:after-deploy` (passed, post-fix)

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm run qa:matrix` -> pass
2. `npm run qa:after-deploy` -> pass
3. `qa/reports/latest_after_deploy.json` -> `status: "passed"`
2. Test results:
1. all 9 matrix device/network cases passed.
2. remote smoke and matrix stages both passed in after-deploy report.
3. Manual checks:
1. inspected matrix report: per-question audio-gate checks pass (`disabledBeforeAudio: true`, `enabledAfterAudio: true`).

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-QA-011`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. QA harness only.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. low; future UX label changes may require locator updates if not selector-based.
3. Follow-up required:
1. PM signoff and push to `main` to sync repository CI behavior.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
