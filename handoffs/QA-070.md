# QA-070 Handoff

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-070
2. Title: Runtime regression + static gates after AI removal
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Executed static gates and runtime reference scans to confirm AI feature removal did not regress student/teacher core flows.
2. What was intentionally not done: Manual exploratory browser testing (automated gates used).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: None.
2. New files: `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-070.md`
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
- `rg -n "teacher-ai|TeacherAi|AI Copilot|VITE_TEACHER_AI_ENABLED|/functions/v1/teacher-ai-query|teacher_ai_query|OPENAI_MODEL|OPENAI_API_KEY" web/src supabase/functions supabase/config.toml .env.example`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: Static build gates and runtime-reference scans.
2. Test results: All gates passed; AI runtime references absent.
3. Manual checks: Verified teacher dashboard source has no AI tab/panel code path.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: `QA-071`, `PM-ANL-011`.
2. Interfaces changed: None by QA.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: Safe to run post-deploy confirmation.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: None.
2. Risks: External environments may still have AI secrets/function until CLI cleanup.
3. Follow-up required: Perform post-deploy verification and hosted cleanup commands.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
