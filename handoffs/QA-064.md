# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-064
2. Title: Add remote smoke pause/resume assertions and run static gates
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Added pause/resume contract checks in remote smoke: pause window, assert student start fails while paused, resume window, proceed with attempt flow; static gates passed.
2. What was intentionally not done: No CI workflow changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/remote_smoke.mjs
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-064.md
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
- `APP_URL=... SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=... TEACHER_PASSCODE=... node qa/remote_smoke.mjs` (pre-deploy expected fail against old runtime)

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: static gates + remote smoke against current deployed environment
2. Test results: static gates passed; remote smoke failed pre-deploy at pause-block assertion, confirming existing production gap addressed by this patch.
3. Manual checks: validated new smoke path and status transition helper.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: PM-QA-021
2. Interfaces changed: none
3. Migration or deployment impacts: requires deployment before remote smoke passes.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: remote smoke remains red until this commit is deployed.
2. Risks: none once deployed.
3. Follow-up required: run post-deploy `qa:remote` and optionally `qa:after-deploy`.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
