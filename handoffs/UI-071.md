# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-071
2. Title: Build teacher AI copilot panel with guided chips and structured response rendering
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Implemented desktop/tablet teacher AI panel with guided prompt chips, filters, structured response sections, lightweight chart rendering, source-metrics display, and session-only history; integrated panel into teacher dashboard with mobile fallback message behind env gate.
2. What was intentionally not done: no mobile full copilot surface (desktop-first only), no persisted chat history.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/shared/types.ts
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/.env.example
2. New files:
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/teacher/teacher-ai-panel.tsx
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/teacher/teacher-ai-chart.tsx
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/UI-071.md
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: passed.
3. Manual checks: AI panel hidden unless `VITE_TEACHER_AI_ENABLED=true`; mobile message shows instead of full panel.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: UI-072, QA-066
2. Interfaces changed: frontend now uses `TeacherAiRequest`/`TeacherAiResponse` contracts and `teacher-ai-query` endpoint.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: requires `VITE_TEACHER_AI_ENABLED` to expose UI in production.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: release-gate script requiring external env was not fully runnable in this shell.
2. Risks: missing teacher session token returns 401 and logs out teacher (expected behavior).
3. Follow-up required: post-deploy QA once CP-10 and CP-11 are cleared.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
