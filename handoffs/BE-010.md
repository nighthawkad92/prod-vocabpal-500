# Handoff: BE-010 Teacher Dashboard Backend Support

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: BE-010
2. Title: Add backend support for latest baseline status and attempt archive
3. Owner Agent: Backend
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added `GET` support in `teacher-windows` to fetch latest baseline window status for toggle UI.
2. Added new edge function `teacher-attempt-archive` to archive an attempt and unlock student retake via archive semantics.
3. Extended dashboard summary class breakdown payload with completed/in-progress counts and completion rate.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no database migration required.
2. no auth/passcode/session model changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `supabase/functions/teacher-windows/index.ts`
2. `supabase/functions/teacher-dashboard-summary/index.ts`
3. New files:
1. `supabase/functions/teacher-attempt-archive/index.ts`
2. `supabase/functions/teacher-attempt-archive/deno.json`
3. `handoffs/BE-010.md`
4. Commands executed:
1. static checks executed later in integrated QA step.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. covered in integrated static gates (`typecheck`, `lint`, `build`).
2. Test results:
1. pass (see QA handoff).
3. Manual checks:
1. backend payloads align with new teacher UI requirements.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `UI-051`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. `teacher-dashboard-summary` class rows now include completion metrics.
2. new `teacher-attempt-archive` endpoint available.
3. `teacher-windows` now supports `GET` for latest status.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. requires deploying updated edge functions.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. archive action is destructive by design (attempt row deletion).
3. Follow-up required:
1. UI confirmation guard + QA verification.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
