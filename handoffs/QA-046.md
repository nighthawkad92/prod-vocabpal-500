# Handoff: QA-046 Automated Hard-Gate Coverage Expansion

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-046
2. Title: Expand automated gate coverage across UI/UX/data/code paths
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added root QA commands: `qa:data`, `qa:release-gate`, `qa:load-500`.
2. Implemented `qa/release_gate.mjs` as an aggregated hard-gate runner producing `latest_release_gate.json`.
3. Updated matrix harness for current 2-step student onboarding and resilient selectors.
4. Added matrix runtime controls: `QA_MATRIX_CASE_LIMIT`, `QA_MATRIX_QUESTIONS_TO_SUBMIT`.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no UI behavior changes beyond test IDs used for stability.
2. no Supabase function code changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `package.json`
2. `qa/matrix_ui_network.mjs`
3. `web/src/features/student/student-mode.tsx`
4. New files:
1. `qa/release_gate.mjs`
2. `handoffs/QA-046.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `node --check qa/matrix_ui_network.mjs`
3. `APP_URL=https://vocabpal.xyz ... npm run qa:matrix`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. matrix one-case smoke (`QA_MATRIX_CASE_LIMIT=1`) -> pass.
2. full matrix 9-case run -> pass.
3. Test results:
1. `qa/reports/latest_matrix_ui_network.json` status `passed` with `9/9` case pass and `16/16` API check pass.
3. Manual checks:
1. onboarding automation now reliably drives `Next -> class/section -> Start test`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-047`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. added optional student onboarding test IDs for QA selector stability.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking QA-046 completion.
2. Risks:
1. matrix runtime remains several minutes due 3x3 profile coverage.
3. Follow-up required:
1. keep matrix selectors aligned with onboarding UI revisions.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
