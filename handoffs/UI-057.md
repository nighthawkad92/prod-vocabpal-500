# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-057
2. Title: Implement mobile width/surface restructure and non-sticky attempts stream
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26T01:37:50Z
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Refactored teacher mobile layout so attempts/search/filter/actions/pagination render on page background (outside cards), removed mobile sticky attempts stream behavior, and retained desktop/tablet card split.
2. What was intentionally not done: No backend/API/schema changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`, `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/components/app-shell.tsx`
2. New files: none
3. Commands executed: static gates via npm scripts (shared with downstream UI/QA tasks).

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: pass
3. Manual checks: Mobile teacher attempts section now scrolls naturally and is no longer rendered in a card container.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: UI-058
2. Interfaces changed: Internal rendering paths in teacher mode only.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: Frontend-only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none blocking.
2. Risks: mobile-only branches in teacher mode require regression coverage.
3. Follow-up required: icon-only and sheet interactions in UI-058/UI-059.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
