5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Built component catalog from implemented primitive inventory.
2. Added metadata-driven interactive playground with tabs and prop/state controls.
3. Rendered real primitives in preview panel: Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Alert, Progress, Switch, Tabs, MotionButton.
4. Added reusable control renderer to keep playground behavior consistent and maintainable.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no business-flow screens added to playground; primitives only.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. none beyond newly added feature files.
2. New files:
1. `web/src/features/design-system/components-section.tsx`
2. `web/src/features/design-system/playground-controls.tsx`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
1. passed.
3. Manual checks:
1. control changes update live preview output without console errors.

3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:

3. Follow-up required:

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
