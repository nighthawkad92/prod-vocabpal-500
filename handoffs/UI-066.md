# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-066
2. Title: Add Clarity loader/env-gating/client wrapper and app-root context tagging
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Implemented `/web/src/lib/clarity.ts` wrapper (`initClarity`, `clarityEvent`, `claritySet`, `clarityIdentifyAttempt`) with allowlisted events/tags, script loader, debug-call logging, and attempt alias hashing; initialized in `App.tsx` with base context tags.
2. What was intentionally not done: No teacher flow instrumentation.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/App.tsx
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/lib/clarity.ts, /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/web/src/types/global.d.ts
3. Commands executed: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: typecheck, lint, build
2. Test results: all passed
3. Manual checks: Wrapper enforces env-gated production load and allowlist-only emission.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: UI-067
2. Interfaces changed: New frontend analytics wrapper API in `clarity.ts`
3. Migration or deployment impacts: Requires `VITE_CLARITY_ENABLED` + `VITE_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID` in Vercel.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none
2. Risks: Tracking disabled silently if env is missing by design.
3. Follow-up required: Student funnel event mapping verification.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
