# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: BE-012
2. Title: Update teacher-windows GET to prioritize latest non-ended window
3. Owner Agent: Backend
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Changed `teacher-windows` GET logic from `limit(1)` latest-created selection to scan recent windows and return the latest non-ended window first; fallback remains latest ended if no active/paused window exists.
2. What was intentionally not done: No schema changes; no changes to student attempt eligibility queries.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/supabase/functions/teacher-windows/index.ts
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/BE-012.md
3. Commands executed: local source inspection and runtime function checks.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: runtime smoke call to `teacher-windows` via Supabase function endpoint.
2. Test results: function responds with expected shape/status in current environment.
3. Manual checks: confirmed selection path now prefers non-ended records.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: QA-062
2. Interfaces changed: response contract unchanged (`hasWindow`, `status`, `window`).
3. Migration or deployment impacts: edge function code deploy only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: if all windows are ended, status remains ended (expected).
2. Risks: query now fetches up to 100 rows; acceptable for current usage.
3. Follow-up required: verify dashboard no longer flips to paused after CI-run cleanup windows are ended.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
