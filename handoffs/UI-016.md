1. none.
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. no compile/lint/build regressions.
3. Manual checks:

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
