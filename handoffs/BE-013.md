# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: BE-013
2. Title: Enforce manual pause semantics in teacher-windows function
3. Owner Agent: Backend
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Hardened `teacher-windows` to avoid implicit paused status: GET now returns `ended` when no window exists; POST rejects paused creation; PATCH pause requires explicit window id and rejects ended window pause.
2. What was intentionally not done: No DB migrations; no change to in-progress/ended transitions.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/supabase/functions/teacher-windows/index.ts
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/BE-013.md
3. Commands executed: local source inspection and static gates.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: `npm --prefix web run typecheck`, `npm --prefix web run lint`, `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results: passed
3. Manual checks: verified pause guard branches and no-window fallback status path.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: UI-069, QA-063
2. Interfaces changed: error responses for invalid pause operations now explicit (400/409)
3. Migration or deployment impacts: edge function deploy required.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none
2. Risks: external callers that try to create paused windows will now receive 400.
3. Follow-up required: observe dashboard behavior after deployment.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
