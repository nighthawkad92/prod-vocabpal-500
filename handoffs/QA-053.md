## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Validated teacher mobile UX changes for icon-only controls, attempts-first browsing, filter bottom-sheet interaction, and full-sheet detail navigation.

1. Tasks unblocked: QA-054
2. Interfaces changed: none
3. Migration or deployment impacts: none

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: none blocking.
