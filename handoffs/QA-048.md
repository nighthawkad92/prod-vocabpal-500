# Handoff: QA-048 Data Integrity Audit Pack

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-048
2. Title: Add data-integrity audit pack for attempts/classes/archive/reopen/time-per-question invariants
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added `qa/data_integrity_audit.mjs` for identity/class isolation, timing integrity, archive/reopen correctness, and dashboard consistency checks.
2. Integrated data audit into `qa/run_after_deploy.mjs` as a required stage.
3. Verified data audit against live environment.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no DB schema changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `qa/run_after_deploy.mjs`
2. New files:
1. `qa/data_integrity_audit.mjs`
2. `handoffs/QA-048.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `APP_URL=https://vocabpal.xyz ... npm run qa:data`
2. `APP_URL=https://vocabpal.xyz ... npm run qa:after-deploy`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. data integrity audit live run.
2. after-deploy orchestration run (deploy poll + smoke + matrix + data audit).
2. Test results:
1. `qa/reports/latest_data_integrity_audit.json` -> `passed` (`8/8` checks).
2. `qa/reports/latest_after_deploy.json` -> `passed`.
3. Manual checks:
1. audit verifies archive removes target attempt and reopens only target student eligibility.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-049`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. QA reporting now includes `latest_data_integrity_audit.json` artifacts.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking this task.
2. Risks:
1. live test data is synthetic but persists as archived rows.
3. Follow-up required:
1. periodic cleanup policy if report volume grows.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
