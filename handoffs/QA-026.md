# Handoff: QA-026 Question Screen Regression + Harness Alignment

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-026
2. Title: Validate question-screen UX regression and QA harness alignment
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Updated matrix harness selectors to use explicit question-screen test hooks.
2. Updated question-counter regex to support `Question N of 10`.
3. Ran static quality gates after UI updates.
4. Executed `qa:remote` and `qa:matrix` to verify harness runtime behavior in this shell.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no production deploy test in this task.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `qa/matrix_ui_network.mjs`
2. `agent_board.md`
3. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-026.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
4. `npm run qa:remote`
5. `npm run qa:matrix`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
4. `npm run qa:remote` -> fail (missing `APP_URL` env var)
5. `npm run qa:matrix` -> fail (missing `APP_URL` env var)
2. Test results:
1. static gates green.
2. integration scripts blocked only by missing required environment variable in local shell.
3. Manual checks:
1. matrix parser and selectors align with new UI text/hooks.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-DS-036`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none beyond automated-test selector expectations.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. `qa:remote` and `qa:matrix` require `APP_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `TEACHER_PASSCODE` in environment.
2. Risks:
1. without env-backed QA rerun, only static gates are verified locally.
3. Follow-up required:
1. rerun `qa:remote` and `qa:matrix` in env-configured shell.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
