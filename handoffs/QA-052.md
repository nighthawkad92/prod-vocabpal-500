# Handoff: QA-052 Mobile Data/Action Parity Checks (Teacher Dashboard)

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-052
2. Title: Data/action parity checks for archive, selection, pagination, filter in mobile mode
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Verified selection model remains shared across attempts list controls and archive actions.
2. Verified pagination and filter state variables remain unchanged by mobile panel switching.
3. Verified archive handlers remain shared between single-detail and bulk-selected flows.
4. Verified showing counters and totals derive from existing backend response fields without mobile-specific divergence.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no backend contract modifications.
2. no schema or migration operations.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `agent_board.md`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/QA-052.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. static gates passed; no type/lint/build regression.
3. Manual checks:
1. selection count drives contextual mobile bulk-action visibility.
2. archive action paths are unchanged and route through shared `archiveAttempts` logic.
3. page/filter/search state persistence remains intact when switching between mobile tabs.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-DS-076`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. frontend deploy only.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. runtime behavioral parity still benefits from post-deploy live teacher-session pass.
3. Follow-up required:
1. execute on-device mobile smoke after deployment.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
