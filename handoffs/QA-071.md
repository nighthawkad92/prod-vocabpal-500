5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Ran full release gate with deployment-aware checks using live env variables; confirmed smoke, matrix, data audit, and after-deploy orchestration completed successfully.
2. What was intentionally not done: Remote function/secret deletion commands (deployment ops follow-up).

## 3. Files and Artifacts

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: `qa:release-gate` (includes static gates + remote smoke + matrix + data + after-deploy).
2. Test results: Passed; reports written under `/Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/reports/`.
3. Manual checks: Verified run produced latest reports for `remote_smoke`, `matrix_ui_network`, `data_integrity_audit`, `after_deploy`, and `release_gate`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: `PM-ANL-011`.
2. Interfaces changed: None by QA.
3. Migration or deployment impacts: Final hosted cleanup still required for Supabase function/secrets and Vercel env key removal.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: None in test outcomes.
2. Risks: If external cleanup is skipped, dormant secrets/function may remain in hosted infra.
3. Follow-up required: run hosted cleanup commands after merge.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
