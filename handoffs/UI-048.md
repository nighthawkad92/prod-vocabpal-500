## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-048
2. Title: Implement completion card redesign, completion artwork, and completion-only background override
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added bundled completion assets: `image-complete.png` and `bg-complete.svg`.
2. Updated student completion state to centered vertical layout with single-column card at `max-w-[450px]`.
3. Replaced completion content with centered `Baseline Complete` title, subtitle (`The only way to go from here is UP!`), and star icon + `Collected: {completion.stars}` line.
4. Removed score, placement stage, and instructional need copy.
5. Added completion-only body class toggle to switch fullscreen pseudo-background to tiled `bg-complete.svg`.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no changes to backend completion payload contract.
2. no changes to question screens beyond completion-state branching.

3. Follow-up required:
1. QA signoff and optional push.
