# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-062
2. Title: Align remote smoke cleanup to end (not pause) and validate static gates
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Updated remote smoke teardown to set QA-created window status to `ended` instead of `paused`, preventing paused latest-window artifacts from dominating dashboard state.
2. What was intentionally not done: no changes to matrix/data/load teardown semantics in this patch.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/qa/remote_smoke.mjs
2. New files: /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-062.md
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run: static gates
2. Test results: passed
3. Manual checks: verified teardown event now logs `session-ended`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked: PM-QA-017
2. Interfaces changed: none
3. Migration or deployment impacts: requires push/deploy for CI workflow to consume updated script.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues: matrix/data/load scripts still create and end windows by design.
2. Risks: none immediate for paused-state regression targeted here.
3. Follow-up required: observe next `qa-after-deploy` run behavior.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
