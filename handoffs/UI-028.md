# Handoff: UI-028 Entry Type-Scale Mapping Implementation

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-028
2. Title: Apply type-scale mapping for `Baseline Test` and split step subtitle roles
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Student entry title `Baseline Test` updated to card-title scale (`text-2xl`).
2. Teacher entry title `Baseline Test` updated to card-title scale (`text-2xl`).
3. Student subtitle split into two role segments:
1. meta/caption segment: `Step X of 2:`
2. body-large segment: step action text
4. Kept step content logic unchanged for step 1 and step 2.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no changes to onboarding flow logic, payload format, or validation.
2. no changes to question screen typography.

## 3. Files and Artifacts

## 4. Validation Evidence
