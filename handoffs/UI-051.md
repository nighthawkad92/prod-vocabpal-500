# Handoff: UI-051 Teacher Dashboard Refactor

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: UI-051
2. Title: Refactor teacher dashboard layout, filters, sticky detail, and archive flow
3. Owner Agent: UI
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-25
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Removed legacy teacher cards: top stat-grid summary, create session, update session, and reopen controls.
2. Added single session toggle (`Paused` / `In Progress`) wired to backend window status.
3. Added class-wise visual dashboard rows with graph + pie visualization.
4. Added attempts search and class filter under Attempts title.
5. Removed per-attempt status text in list cards.
6. Added sticky attempt detail panel with richer details and question-level metrics.
7. Added archive action with required confirmation copy; archive refreshes list/detail and reopens baseline access.
8. Increased teacher app-shell width to ~85% viewport.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no student flow updates.
2. no database schema changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `web/src/features/teacher/teacher-mode.tsx`
2. `web/src/features/shared/types.ts`
3. `web/src/components/app-shell.tsx`
2. New files:
1. `handoffs/UI-051.md`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
2. Test results:
1. static gates green after teacher dashboard refactor.
3. Manual checks:
1. search + class filter positioned below Attempts title.
2. attempt detail card remains sticky while left list scrolls.
3. archive button triggers confirmation dialog with required copy.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `QA-043`
2. Interfaces changed:
1. `TeacherSummary.classBreakdown` expanded with completion fields.
2. `TeacherWindowState` type added for latest status fetch.
3. `TeacherAttemptDetail.responses` typing expanded to include question metadata/timestamps.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. backend edge functions must be deployed with frontend update.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. none blocking.
2. Risks:
1. archive operation permanently removes attempt records.
3. Follow-up required:
1. PM signoff + deploy/push.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
