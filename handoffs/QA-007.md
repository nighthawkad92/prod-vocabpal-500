# Handoff: QA-007 Design-System Regression

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-007
2. Title: Design-system route/functionality regression
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-24
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
1. Added `/designsystem` route health check to `qa:remote`.
2. Added `/designsystem` render assertion to matrix suite API checks.
3. Executed frontend quality gates: typecheck, lint, build.
4. Executed `qa:remote` against local app with Supabase-backed APIs and verified report pass.
5. Ran `qa:matrix` and captured environment-specific failure mode evidence.
2. What was intentionally not done:
1. no backend/API code changes.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
1. `qa/remote_smoke.mjs`
2. `qa/matrix_ui_network.mjs`
3. `qa/README.md`
2. New files:
1. `qa/reports/latest_remote_smoke.json`
2. `qa/reports/latest_matrix_ui_network.json`
3. Commands executed:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
2. `npm --prefix web run lint`
3. `npm --prefix web run build`
4. `APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 ... npm run qa:remote`
5. `APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4173 ... npm run qa:matrix`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
1. `npm --prefix web run typecheck` -> pass
2. `npm --prefix web run lint` -> pass
3. `npm --prefix web run build` -> pass
4. `npm run qa:remote` -> pass
5. `npm run qa:matrix` -> fail (all 9 cases)
2. Test results:
1. Matrix failure is not a design-system regression. Cases fail at `student-start-attempt` due network fetch timeout from localhost to Supabase (same failure signature across all profiles).
2. Added `/designsystem` check passed in matrix API checks (`designsystem-route-render: pass`).
3. Manual checks:
1. Headless browser assertion confirmed `/designsystem` heading renders.
2. Failure screenshot shows student form error banner `Failed to fetch` prior to attempt start.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
1. `PM-DS-002` (with residual risk note).
2. Interfaces changed:
1. none.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
1. none.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
1. local matrix execution remains sensitive to Supabase CORS allowlist for localhost origins.
2. Risks:
1. if production deployment is not re-verified post-push, `/designsystem` runtime route health on prod remains unproven in this run.
3. Follow-up required:
1. run `qa:after-deploy` after pushing these commits.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
