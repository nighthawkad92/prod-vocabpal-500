# PM Handoff

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: REL-002 (DES-139)
2. Title: Pilot readiness checklist signoff
3. Owner Agent: PM
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-27
5. Proposed Next State: `BLOCKED`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed:
   - Performed release readiness check against current dependency and QA evidence.
   - Created explicit readiness checklist with gate outcomes and exit conditions.
   - Confirmed non-load dependencies completed (`DES-12`, `DES-15`, `DES-16`, `DES-17`).
2. What was intentionally not done:
   - Did not force a go-signoff while hard blocker remained.

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
   - None
2. New files:
   - `knowledge-base/release/rel-002-pilot-readiness-checklist-2026-02-27.md`
3. Commands executed:
   - Evidence review against latest QA reports and Linear state.

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
   - Referenced existing latest load report and completed dependency issue states.
2. Test results:
   - `QA-004` remains blocked due load-threshold failures.
3. Manual checks:
   - Verified dependency state on `DES-12`, `DES-14`, `DES-15`, `DES-16`, `DES-17`, `DES-140`.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
   - None; this handoff clarifies blocker resolution path.
2. Interfaces changed:
   - None.
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
   - None.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
   - Load profile blocker unresolved (`DES-14`).
2. Risks:
   - Releasing without load mitigation raises classroom disruption risk.
3. Follow-up required:
   - Performance remediation/waiver decision and incident ticket disposition.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Move to `BLOCKED` pending load-gate and incident resolution
