# Handoff Template

## 1. Metadata
1. Task ID: QA-068
2. Title: Validate backend contract, completed-only enforcement, stage-bucket accuracy
3. Owner Agent: QA
4. Handoff Date: 2026-02-26
5. Proposed Next State: `REVIEW`

## 2. Summary of Work
1. What was completed: Verified backend changes enforce completed-only analytics and updated contract (`classNames[]`, `24h/7d/30d/all`, no `actions`) via code-level inspection and static compile checks.
2. What was intentionally not done: Live after-deploy API verification (missing local env gate variables).

## 3. Files and Artifacts
1. Files changed:
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-068.md
2. New files:
- /Users/akashdatta/Desktop/prod-vocabpal-baseline-500/handoffs/QA-068.md
3. Commands executed:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`

## 4. Validation Evidence
1. Tests run:
- `npm --prefix web run typecheck`
- `npm --prefix web run lint`
- `npm --prefix web run build`
2. Test results:
- passed
3. Manual checks:
- Confirmed `teacher_analytics.ts` query path uses `.eq("status", "completed")` and stage bucket logic.

## 5. Downstream Impact
1. Tasks unblocked:
- QA-069
2. Interfaces changed:
- none
3. Migration or deployment impacts:
- recommend post-deploy API smoke.

## 6. Open Issues
1. Known issues:
- `qa:remote` and `qa:release-gate` blocked locally due missing required env.
2. Risks:
- runtime-only issues must be validated in deployed environment.
3. Follow-up required:
- run `qa:after-deploy` after push.

## 7. Requested PM Action
1. Mark as `DONE`
2. Return to `RUNNING` with rework scope
3. Move to `BLOCKED` pending checkpoint id
